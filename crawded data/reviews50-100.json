If it's affordable and available in the US, I've probably tried it. I even got on the birth control pill in hopes that it would regulate my hormones and clear my face up. I was obsessed with trying every face mask I could get my hands on and picked this one up expecting that it would probably work about as well as the next thing. Brought it home, put it on, and on the first rinse I noticed a difference. You hear that a lot in advertising, but I can honestly say that this was the first thing I'd ever tried that made a difference on the first use. Of course it's not a pimple eraser. All those red angry spots were still there afterwards, but they were a lot less red and angry. :) It definitely shrank my pores on the first use and helped with blackheads, too. My skin type when I was a teen was very oily, and the mask took the oil out and made my face matte, which was a miracle at the time because I was ALWAYS shiny.

So, I went on EWG's website to find a recommended facial sunscreen and found this to have a rating of 2 which made me really excited since Amazons reviews were almost all positive. I will say the price has gone up quite a bit since I started purchasing this about 9 months ago, but I just buy it where I can get it the cheapest (about $22 per bottle). There isn't a thing that I don't love about this product. It is paraben free, light weight but very moisturizing, does not leave my skin ashy looking despite having zinc in the ingredients, and comes in the best packaging for a face cream which is a pump style bottle that cannot be opened to allow air inside. My skin is fair and my cheeks burn fairly easily in the sun, but I have never had a problem since using this even on the sunniest days. I really appreciate the high level of niacinamide since I truly believe it's an ingredient which has improved my skin. My cheeks used to be very pink and they have calmed down dramatically in the last 6 months. What I will say is good to know based on my experience is that it may be hard to tell when you're running low because the bottle is already light weight, so after about 6 weeks of daily use, it would be about time for another bottle. Also, I have not had any allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in this cream but some other people have said they have. Unfortunately I can't comment on that since it hasn't happened to me.
