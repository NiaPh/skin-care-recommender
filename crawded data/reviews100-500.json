I have used this for over 1 year and at first I was very unsure it would work.  I actually stopped for a few weeks.  I have a ton of moderate to occasional severe acne for about 15 years now, yes the type where you hide for a few days, but after using this, I must say it is not a cure, but the best solution I have come across to keep your skin looking great!  Yes, I have tried a billion products.  There are two things that work on my white, male, oily skin.  This Salicylic acid and clean and cure's benzoyl peroxide.  I use that cream every night, and I use this acid 2 times each week.  Yes, every 3-4 days I find is right on. At first I used it just once a week.  I had massive stinging, and it was very  very painful.  I frosted, etc.  When you are new, and have that much dead skin on your face, you should use very very little.  On day 3 after using this acid, you will have peeling going on.  When I first started, I used more then I should have hence the pain and frosting, to the point that 3 days later when I peeled, it was not good to see me in public even with lotion on.  I mean I was shedding like no tomorrow and red around my mouth.  I was losing so much skin it was not a good thing.  After applying this acid in smaller amounts each week for a few months, yes months, the pain went away, my skin shedded a ton of dead skin, and I could not believe how great my skin looked!  Did I still have acne.  Yes.  Was it visible, hardly.  Now if you do it and feel very little pain, you do not have moderate acne, most people have mild acne out there, so you will think it is not working.  Let me tell you, if you use this, and benzoyl peroxide like I do, you will clear up.  This acid needs time to get deep down to do it's work every 3 days and the cream to help kill the stuff when you are not using the acid.  Now that I do one treatment every 3 days, I am and have been mostly clear of acne.  About 90-95 percent.  I feel and look awesome.  However, if I let it lapse even one week, I will start to get breakout acne again as all that dead skin is being piled up by the cream which alone can't keep it at bay.  Without the cream, I break out some, this alone is not going to clear you 100 percent if it is active acne, but with help of the benzoyl peroxide, it is the perfect solution to freedom!  What I mean is no more glossing looking oily skin, you may now workout and sweat without worring you are going to break out massively due to your clogged pores.  You actually sweat because your pores are not clogged, and you don't break out if you continue using this acid with peroxide.  Also, I have had tons of whiteheads on my back for many years until this acid and this has been slowly making them go away as it dissolves them a little each time I apply it.  I do not peel at all when I use it on my back because it is not active acne anymore, but just old dead acne whitehead bumps under a new layer of skin that won't go away on it's own since it is protected by the new skin.  This was the first place my acne started when I was 15.  It stopped breaking out at about age 25 on my back.  I am now 31 and my acne is just on my face now but still moderate if I leave it untreated.  The new skin on my back is not dead so it does not peel when I use it.  However the acid gets under and disolves the oil.  I just see shriking and smoothing skin appearing slowly as the whiteheads go bye bye.  I can finally take my shirt off without looking horrible.  It has taken months, but it is worth every penny this acid is worth!  Amazing product, best I have in my solution to fighting acne.  The less dead skin you have on your face when you use it, the less pain you will feel.  I do it every 3 days so I feel very little more like a itch for about 15 minutes then I wash it off and the pinkness of my face fades away by the 30 minute mark.  You must get this, forget reading the people that tried it once and stopped.  They didn't give it time to work.  It needs time to exfoliate all the garbage on your skin which is plugging your pores.

Unilever changed the product in very significant and inferior way, they have bought out many good \"natural\" or \"organic\" companies and have done the same thing. The preservative Phenoxyethanol, a formaldehyde-releasing preservative, is limited to use in Japan at 1%.  It used to be the last ingredient before fragrance and now it is towards the top.. Being the 7th ingredient is is very worrisome and potentially dangerous, meaning there is much more phenoxyethanol preservative than any other beneficial ingredients. In fact, collagen and elastin are now the last ingredients, there is even more fragrance in the new and unimproved product than collagen and elastin, the last ingredients. The number of ingredients have stayed the same, but all of the beneficial ingredients (sunflower seed oil, collagen and elastin) have been made insignificant compared to the cheap and potentially harmful preservative and fillers that are way too high on the list.

For those of US that MUST look our best, without the pretense, fake and unnatural results, you must try this product! Don't get me wrong, I don't mind getting older, just don't want to LOOK OLDER than I am - as this is what gradually happens to our skin as we age. St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer is absolutely, the very best out there for the price and the amount of product that you are getting-it is sooooooooooooooo worth it. The results are literally overnight. The emphasis being RESULTS!!! If not within days, you will DEFINITELY see the results within a week. Results: supple, vibrant, resilient, youthful, glowing looking skin. As with age, my skin was becoming very dry, blotchy, dark circles and fine lines under the eyes and something weird going on around my neck area. Wasn't having it!!! St. Ives has literally reversed this aging process within days. I also use St. Ives lotion equivalent(large bottle)on my once \"cracked\" skin for my legs - with IMMEDIATE and amazing results. No more cracked, dry, aging looking skin on my lower legs and feet. This product is very hard to find in stores (even here in New York). I ordered the St. Ives Collagen Elastin Face Moisturizer by the case of 6 (as my husband uses it too). Just to note, I also use the Good N Natural Retinol Cream (Amazon sells it). For me at the age of 50, these two combinations does wonders for my face and skin (people always complement my skin, they always want to know \"what do you use on your face?\" or \"what make-up do you use?\" (even when I'm not wearing any make-up -foundation that is). And, the all time favorite \"you can't be 50\"!!! - people often guess my age around 35-40. Also, for me, the Retinol Cream adds an extra glow and boost-in my opinion. I also use Palmer's Eventone Fade Cream (to keep my face/skin even-toned-a must for African American women or women of color). Also for the large pores use WitchHazel and/or Hydrogen Peroxide (with cold water/or ice cubes to the face). Keep the body and face very clean and well exfoliated. Drink lots and lots of water. Take your calcium, C, E and Bcomplex vitamin regularly. Go for brisk walks. Eat right/better and reduce the stress. It all helps in long-term maintenance. Well, that's my non-licensed, average cutey, womanly, expert advice (lol!!!). Lastly, I'm posting because I really want to help those that have wasted their money on expensive and often bogus products - as I despise a \"con\" advertisement and product. If you are looking for something that is inexpensive, lots of product for your money and IMMEDIATE results - this is definitely it!I had never heard of this product before nor have I ever used it before. I tried it because of the Amazon reviews and the words \"elastin and \"collagen\", as I learned by beauty experts (in my internet research) that a woman needs to replace the collagen in her skin after a certain age. Can't tell you how many jars, tubes and bottles of \"junk\" (expensive junk, I might add) that I've purchased over the years and regimens I've tried - that DID NOT WORK as well as this product has. Since using this, I have not used foundation or cover-up makeup, unless I go out formally or on a professional assignment (for that diva-pretty, beautiful and flawless look) and that's by choice and NOT because I HAVE TO anymore...hope this helps and all the best!", "summary": "LADIES, LADIES, LADIES!!!

However, I saw this pop up on here and felt compelled to share my thoughts on the product. This product gave me awful headaches and made me skin look aged when I wore makeup on top of it. After about a week of wearing this, I noticed awful headaches concentrated in my forehead area. The forehead, particularly the muscles above eyebrows, were painful to touch. After a week of having these headaches and cutting out various things in my diet that I thought could be the cause, the headaches were still there. Finally I dawned on me that I was wearing new face cream. I went to the bathroom and washed it off really well and within minutes the headache lessened. After a couple of days of not wearing the cream, they were gone completely. It's been a few weeks since then and the headaches haven't come back. And it wasn't the scent. I found the scent pleasant and light, not to mention I love fragrance. I've never had a bad reaction to anything I've put on my skin so I wouldn't consider myself sensitive at all. Furthermore, my skin looked so much worse when I put this on before wearing makeup. Even when I gave it plenty of time to set in and settle.

Specifically, a mix between Pert Plus and Pantene. It doesn't smell bad per se, but it is a pretty strong scent. You will be smelling it on your face after you apply it. If you don't like the idea of slathering Pert all over your face, you might not like this scent. I would rather do without it, but it isn't a drawback for me. I do love the consistency, texture and how quickly it dries. It's that perfect consistency between not leaving your face greasy, and not being so fast drying that you can't even evenly apply it.

However, as an RN with additional credentials in biochemistry, I think some may find the method of application I prefer will achieve the results you seek a bit quicker and be less irritating to the skin.  This process was developed in conjunction with my dermatologist.  I make no miracle claims or promises about your results.  I'm 62 and my skin has a soft smooth appearance with no wrinkles visible anywhere except the deep expression wrinkles on my forehead.  Be patient as it has taken a couple years to see the total effects of this regimen.  My routine begins in the morning in my shower:  Wash and rinse your face with Cerave facial soap.  I use this soap to wash my entire body because it keeps your skin soft and smooth between showers. After your shower, give your face a final rinse.  Do not dry your face.  Dry your body and slip your bathrobe on.  Now apply 3 drops of Hyaluronic Acid Serum to one of your palms.  Next apply 3 drops of Timeless Vitamin C serum to your palm and mix together.  Your face should still be quite damp.  The serums will quickly absorb both serums.  The vitamin C is added to help even skin tone and these serums have a synergistic effect when applied together.  Nest apply the Cerave moisturizer that contains a sunscreen of SPF 50+.  This moisturizer is soothing and gives your skin the most important part of this regimen.  APPLY TO YOUR NECK and d\u00e9colletage.  Don't forget the sides and back of your neck. Next apply your primer and makeup.  With time your skin texture will become noticeably smoother to touch.  Any discoloration will slowly fade and you may need a lighter foundation.  I have stopped wearing foundation unless I am going out. Before bedtime, I remove all my makeup with Olay disposable makeup remover wipes, wash my face with Cerave soap repeating the AM routine using moisturized without sunscreen. Well, that's the combo that works for me.  I wrote this with a little hesitation after reading the review by the medical student.  However, this is a cheap way to get fantastic results while using budget-friendly ingredients.

I'm a medical student, which leads to two things: bags under your eyes from lack of sleep and too much caffeine, and a bit of insight into stuff like hyaluronic acid!

I decided to do some research to see if it can penetrate the skin, or if it just sits on the surface.

I make sure to mix this with some purified water or rose water hydrosol before mixing it into any facial creams or lotions. I usually apply this at night and in the morning I wake up with plumped up skin and fine lines greatly lessened. Two things I have found with this. One, that when I mix it , first with a bit of water, and apply to my undereye area and then QUICKLY sealing it in with an eye cream, it thickens the skin of my undereye area and that lightens my dark circles! It doesn't make them go away but they do lighten up noticeably. I'm not a scientist but my guess is that when this skin plumps up from the hyaluronic acid that the upper layer of skin is being lifted up away from the darkness under the eye thus causing some of the darkness to be reduced.  Second, I like to mix this with purified water, or rosewater hydrosol, and QUICKLY apply to my lips and then again QUICKLY seal it in with a thick lip balm. In the morning I wake up with plumped up lips! If I add a bit too much it almost gives me what in plastic surgery is called \"trout pout\". I am not kidding!

I recommend it to all of my friends. The color is wonderful, not orange at all, a dark brown tone like you'd want, and its instant! For the first time ever I was actually called tan. I was in love.

The color fades off me quite quickly, id say within 2 or 3 days I'm not very dark anymore, and I can barely see tan lines.. especially on my legs and back, and face. Within a day my face is back to the normal tone, so I have to add more. I have very sensitive skin and this gives me no breakouts at all. But is DOES dye the hair follicles on my legs...if you were to pay close attention to them it looks like I have little tiny brown dots on them, almost like they're dirty. Now maybe I just use too much, since I am VERY light skinned, it takes a whole lot (like 6 sprays on each leg directly onto the skin) to get me a tanned color. Keep in mind this tan lasts like 2 or 3 days (one for my face) then I am back to my normal color. I have no problems with it rubbing off on my clothing, shaving does take off some of the color, it goes on mostly even too. So overall I would give it a 3.5 stars..But since I love the color so much, 4 stars. I just hate having to spend almost 20$ for 2 weeks, maybe 2 1/2 weeks of good tan.

You're supposed to scrub your body down first, which they sell a scrub (seperately, of course), but I just use a scrub I bought from the drugs store. Then I recommend you spray it onto the mitt and then rub onto your body, I did the mistake of trying to spray it onto my legs and got tanner all over my bathroom. I did one leg so that I could compare it to the other and it wasn't that drastic of a change. Gave it a slight tint, which I liked. To me, that means it wouldn't be super obvious, right? Well, there were times I got carried away and by the time I was walking out the door, I felt like my feet looked kind of orange. If you don't get carried away, and use it just the once a week (as is recommended) it won't be a dramatic change, but a nice subtle tan.

It's becoming extremely important to wear sunscreen these days, and Banana Boat is an awesome choice for you and your family this summer. This particular sunscreen is only SPF 30, but it provides protection against both UVA and UVB rays that cause skin cancer. Competitor brands may advertise a higher amount of SPF protection, but may only protect against the UVB rays. So, don't get fooled by high SPF numbers, because you need protection from both Ultra-Violet A and B rays, which can both do damage and cause skin cancer. Also, at SPF 30, you are protecting yourself from 97 percent of the UVA/UVB rays, so anything higher then 30 is only giving minimal more benefits. This product is also awesome because it is water resistant for 1.5 hours and it isn't greasy like many other sun lotions.

I go through a whole lot of facial wipes because I wipe my face once when I wake up before I wash my face and again to take off some makeup before I wash my face and go to bed so I'm constantly trying these wipes and so far they are my favorite. I don't have super sensitive skin but I do have pretty oily skin all around I wouldn't even consider myself combination I'm just oily and these were gentle on my skin and didn't help me be less oily but didn't make the problem worse either. At first I only tried the regular simple cleansing facial wipes which I loved and have gone through three packages. However I tried the exfoliating wipes and they did break me out but I later learned I can't exfoliate my face with any type of product or it badly breaks me out regardless of brand. I tried two wipes so far of the new oil balancing wipe and so far I'm in love I used one last night with my normal routine and then this morning before I washed my face then I did my normal makeup routine and I noticed my makeup stayed on better and longer and instead of blotting three times a day I only blotted once so they really are helping. There is a very slight smell that isn't like anything I've ever smelled but its very faint and I have a sensitive nose and it doesn't bother me at all and it doesn't linger, sometimes the scent of a product is a make or break for me because if I don't like it I don't want to smell it on my face all day. Plus they really are soft gentle wipes I don't feel them scratching my skin and they don't leave a film or mask on me afterwords. The very best thing about this product is how quick and easy it gets off all my makeup I don't need to waste and use multiple wipes and I can get off my entire face of makeup, eye liner and then I hold it on my eye lashes for a second and wipe a few times and even water proof mascara comes off pretty easy with these wipes without them burning my eyes out of my head. Probably the only bad thing I could even mention about the product if I had to is the price, its comparable to basically every other brand unless you opt for store brand but $5.99-$7.99 does seem to be a bit pricey all across the board for facial wipes so I definitely opt for the simple brand they've been the best for the money.", "summary": "Love these so much :)", "helpful": 0}, {"asin": "B00AO4EL34", "overall": "5", "reviewText": "I've just received my very first bzz campaign, very exciting stuff.

Because of this I was skeptical in trying new products, I didn't want to spend the week hiding in the house so no one would see my skin!

Zinc PCA is proven to give a freshness to the skin and Glycerin is proven to improve smoothness and lubrication of the skin, the presence of these ingredients, minus all the harsh ingredients normally found in skin care products, made me super excited to try it!

That being said i didnt like this product at first it actually seemed to make my eyes look a lil worse it seemed after a week. But i read the reviews saying to use it for a few weeks so i continued. After the 2nd week i noticed improvement. I had a lil puffiness and 2 fine line semi circles under each eye that i wanted to get rid of. Gradually by 3rd week i noticed a big difference. A coworker asked if i was using botox cause i looked younger. So i knew others saw a difference. I just ordered my 2nd bottle. I use twice a day. This is the best under eye i have used. I used to use creams thinking gels would dry me out. This stuff is awesome. I WISH i had taken before pic. I will say tho that if i skip a day it seems like my eyes start to droop and puff slightly but that could be my imagination. In any case i rated it 5 stars because i have used countless creams that gave me only minimal results. This gel after 2 months now has flattened the under part of my eye. Wrinkles are gone. Skin is tight and smooth. Im 37 and can pass for 25 (when i shave. Lol). I always read a mix of all reviews before ordering a product and weigh the good against the bad.

Wow. Best decision in a long time! I really like the product itself. Goes on so smooth and smells very faintly of cucumber. I personally have many issues with scent and this one doesn't bother me at all. Probably because it's a natural scent as opposed to man-made. I have those dreaded eye bags/dark circles that make you appear 10 years older than you really are. Plus, the purplish inner eye color that is caused by allergies. I've been using this for 10 weeks (I just looked that up!) along with the Youth Express Eye Serum, twice daily. At first I just liked the way it moisturized. I could feel it tightening the bags under my eyes immediately. I took some pics on my cell at 2 weeks intervals (more or less) and transferred them to the computer so I could magnify and look at them side by side. There is a definite difference, especially between 4 or 5 weeks ago and maybe two weeks ago ( I took the pictures without makeup on). I can see the wrinkles are softer and seem to be filling in somehow. My dark circles are not nearly as dark as they were, and I surely am not getting any more sleep than usual. My bags are not gone by any means (they are displaced fat-nothing short of surgery can take them away, alas), but the are not nearly as noticeable. I can't even explain it, I just know my entire eye area has undergone a transformation of some kind! I imagine the most important thing I can say is this; I was in the ladies room at work the other day, and as I walked by the mirror, I actually did a double-take. I see my face every day, obviously, but I finally actually noticed the difference this product is making. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this eye gel. Try it, and make sure you give it a chance. The company does state on their website that most customers notice a real improvement after 2 months or so. I certainly did.  One more thing. As I had said, I've been using this twice daily for 10 weeks, and not just on my eyes. I use it on those lines that run from your nose to your mouth, and also on a couple of wrinkle on my forehead and especially on my neck. Pretty much I use it wherever I need to, twice a day.

There is a degree of tightening, but it is not the unnatural look you get with some products that \"cracks\" the minute you smile or talk.

This is my 4th product, Eclos being the first (works well but difficult to find), No. & (rosacea did NOT like), and Boot's Botanics (horrid smelling and rosacea irritating), then this stuff. The Regenerist system is wonderful. I use oil to remove my makeup, the cream cleanser to deep clean, then the serum and the cream. The latter I use in the morning and evening. My skin is silky and moisturized, and my fine lines have disappeared (I do not have any deep lines yet, so I can't speak to those). Most exciting (and unanticipated) is that my rosacea has improved after 1 week's use, the redness and sensitivity is nearly gone, which is a miracle during the winter months. It is much pricier than making all my own stuff, but well worth it for the fantastic results. I have two photos, one is a typical my-face shot, and the other (the one that insists on being effing sideways, sorry) is after a week's use.

I\u02bbve been using it for 2 years, and it\u02bbs all the great things that people say it is.  I recently ran out of it and decided, for convenience, to open a subscription with Amazon and have a jar sent to me every two months.  I received my first order a couple days ago.  As soon as I put it on my face, I noticed it was different. The formula that I'm used to always left my face feeling plump and soft, but this formula didn\u02bbt do that at all.  I looked at the jar and noticed it looked different from the empty jar of cream that I had used before.  Mostly everything about the two jars was the same, except the one I got from Amazon was a deeper color red, and the silver cover did not say OLAY on the top (like it does in the photos on Amazon). When I picked up and read the box, it said MADE IN THAILAND.  I went back to the Amazon website to read it\u02bbs product description, and it clearly says MADE IN THE US.  So I called the OLAY number that was on the box to speak to a representative.  After explaining the situation, she said basically that they are a global company and have factories and distribution centers all over the world, but that any Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream sold in the USand Canada is made in Puerto Rico.  So..neither the USA or Thailand.  She went on to say I would have to speak to the seller to find out where they are receiving their product from.  So I called Amazon and spoke to a Customer Service Rep, and he didn't really have an answer for me either, just saying that he will notify those in charge that the product description doesn\u02bbt match the actual product. He did cancel my subscription, and refunded me the cost of the first jar.

One of the best tips I can suggest is lightly rubbing lotion on areas where you may have dry skin (elbows, knees and wrists/knuckles) before applying. The tanner will not adhere to the areas where you apply lotion (ie: no streaks, creases or tan lines). I use circular motions and just lightly buff the tanner onto my skin. Depending on what sort of tan I want I will vary the hours I leave it on for absorption. For a quick process I'll usually leave it on for 5-6 hours then rinse and then sometimes I'll go to bed with it on and just rinse in the morning. DO NOT be alarmed when you go to shower and see product washing off your body. It is SUPPOSED to do that (it's just excess). The color that absorbed into your skin will be there and for me, it's always a beautiful natural tan glow. Tips for extending the life of your tanner? Use a moisturizing lotion after every shower, don't use scalding hot water when you bathe and do NOT exfoliate post tan. My tan will last me anywhere from 1-2 weeks depending on activities/showers. I highly recommend this product. If you're experiencing problems it's most likely user error and it will just require a little more practice but once you get the hang of it, it is a cinch!!!!!

Before I begin, I am 21 years old and extremely fair. As a child, I was decidedly ginger/strawberry blonde, so my skin WILL NOT tan - not then, not now. I've tried a lot of sunless tanners throughout my middle school/high school/collegiate struggle to be tan (or at least a normal, non-ghost shade).

IF You READ and FOLLOW the directions it will not streak and will last a good week. Before applying, make sure to shower and exfoliate at NIGHT, preferably right before bedtime. (If you do this in the morning or daytime it does not have time to set properly!!)  If you shave your legs beforehand make sure to rinse, your whole body and especially your shaved legs, with COLD water at the end of your shower. This will close your pores and you won't get brown discoloration spots at your shaving sites.  Apply it with the mitt right after your shower and it will apply much smoother as your skin is softer and more supple.  Just like applying body lotion after you shower, it soaks in easier.  It's quick drying so you don't have to wait but a few minutes before putting on your pjs.  I do my legs last and find that my top half is dry by the time I finish with my legs.  I throw on my top and wait a few minutes to put on my shorts or bottoms.  That's it!  It doesn't stain my sheets and there is only a little discoloration on the back neck of my top in the morning.  Also, I do NOT shower the next morning but wait until that evening or even the following morning.  This will really help set the application and make the color last.  People's reviews that complain it sucks aren't following the directions.  I cannot stress enough to READ and FOLLOW the directions!  If you apply this in the morning or during the daytime it will come off and streak as you wash your hands or splash water on any treated areas of your skin!  Also, don't use your body scrubby between applications, use shower gel or soap only.  This may sound like it's a pain to use, it's really not.

My skin looks nice and pretty. I actually think it stands up pretty good, I have fairly oily skin on my forehead that I always have to worry about so I did a 'test' and waited 6 hours to see how oily it got. Not very much! I just had a tiny little bit. I definitely think using a makeup sponge helps so much in applying it - if your getting oily and your just using your hands or a makeup brush use a sponge instead! I've been using it about a week and i haven't broken out, my skin is extremely sensitive so I would've known very quickly if it was going to. And I will say my skin does actually look better!
