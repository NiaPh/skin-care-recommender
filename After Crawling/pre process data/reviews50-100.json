I also used a product called Principal Secret: blemish buster solution which contains sulfur which is excellent at getting rid of zits. Unfortunately this spot treatment of sulfur is almost 30 dollars for a .5oz bottle. To my surprise, the mint julep mask contains sulfur and can be used as a spot treatment as well. I use the mask once a week, and wash my face once everyday with St. Ives apricot scrub (without salicylic acid) and have seen amazing results. I have had really great results with this mask and my zits have disappeared completely. Every once and a while I will have one start to pop up, but I use the apricot scrub to open the pores then follow with a dab of this (leave on overnight) and do my weekly one application per week routine and the result is great.

It needed to have a pleasant smell and also last longer than a one time application.. Well! I have been using this tanner for a year and I must say.. it's the best by FAR. It's pretty intense so if you apply it with your bare hands, your palms will be completely dark brown. So! With that being said.. I went the drug store and got myself some non-latex gloves and I make sure to put those on when I apply the lotion. For the girls who complain about it being green -- It is supposed to be green to give you an olive skin complexion. Yes - the results are instant. But it's more of an olive tint.. but when it dries you get the more brown/tan color. Let's say I have plans to go out that evening/night - If I hop in the shower at 4pm and put it on after I get out and let it dry.. by the time I leave the house at 6pm I will look a few shades darker. I've never had a problem with it staining my clothes, but that's because I wait for it to dry before getting dressed. I use this on my face as well. It's awesome for those times when you have to wear a short dress and think to yourself \"OMG my legs are so pale!\" Put this lotion on and you'll be set! I get compliments all the time on my summer glow. Or I get asked \"How do you stay so tan in the winter?\" I'd say on average after a one time application, you will have a tan for 3 days.

The next time that I use it I will be trying the mitt and seeing what the results are the mitt is made of a very soft fabric and might work better to apply the self tanner in circular motions.

The smell doesn't last very long either. It might linger in your bathroom for a few minutes but that's it. I had a breakout on my face after applying either this, or the Raw Infused shea butter with coconut and papaya so I'm not applying this on my face anymore. I'm going to be trying all the soaps and lotions on the Nubian Heritage line. So far, I will not be purchasing the coconut and papaya soap again unless I see a significant difference in my skin after the bar soap is gone. I would say I don't necessarily have problem skin. Just my stomach and back is darker than my body so I'm trying to even it out.. Might do an update if I see any differences in my skin..", "summary": "The smell -_-", "helpful": 4}, {"asin": "B000J41MNG", "overall": "1", "reviewText": "Face has a few light blemishes , but no pimples now (thank god).

I was using a Swiss Department Store brand call Celllap or Cellmen, and worked at the beginning, but was costing thousands of dollars and my forehead wrinkles we're going away.  They always had another cream or treatment or small expensive vials to sell me.  My wife was using it with better results, so I researched all the creams that didn't smell like a flower.  Hydroxatone was consistently rated high.  So I ordered from the Company direct and they were sending me refills way more than I needed, at 5 times the price.  I was astonished Amazon was selling it for a very reasonable price and it is the same thing, contrary to what a lot of comments on the product are reporting.  You have to keep the cream air-tight (there is an inside sealer) and the cap thightened.  Otherwise, it separates.  You should also take it our of the jar with an applier (I use the inside sealer or a small plastic spoon) and not your dirty fingers.  This will also contaminate the contents if done regularity.  So try it, and use it regularly, and you will see a difference over time.  You have to be vigilant and use it at least once a day.  You may have friends say, \"I have known you for a long time, and your face makes you look at lot younger than you really are!  Tell me what you are using and where I can get it!\"  This has happened more than once.  And there is no smell, it doesn't cause bruises and its invisible on your face while it works to make you look years younger.  It even helps with scarring, but erases the wrinkles like magic with no side effects.  You can purchase it elsewhere for over $100.00 for the same jar, but with Amazon, you don't even have to go up to the counter in a Drug or Department Store and purchase it in the women's cosmetic section.", "summary": "Nice Anti-Wrinkle Fragrance-Free secret for Men...that Works!", "helpful": 6}, {"asin": "B000R46I1O", "overall": "5", "reviewText": "I have used this product many times over the years and  have tried others in between (Lanc\u00f4me, etc).

Over the 10 days, I put a little on each morning before makeup and at night after washing my face. By the end of the ten days, I could see a marked difference in the skin texture around my eyes, smoother, more even tone and more supple. I'm 58, so I will take every good bit of luck I can get! As the trip was drawing to a close, I was thinking that I'd miss this product a lot until I could find a place to purchase it for myself. As we were packing our suitcases, my friend handed me the tube and said I should keep it, that she'd bought a set of three and still had two at home. SCORE! What a great gift that was. That was back in October 2012. It's February 2013 and I still have a bit left in the tube she gave me so it's just now time to replace it. I highly recommend this cream. Your makeup will apply smoother, your skin will feel silky and moisturized and the scent is a nutty and faint coffee fragrance, which I'm sure is what parts of heaven smell like. Note: I also put a little around my lips to smooth out those fine lines that make lipstick look like you applied it with a wallpaper paste brush. It sort of puffs the lip a bit to give me back a smoother lipline. I love this stuff and only wish it came in a bigger container for home and a tiny one for my purse to touch up throughout the day.

I mix half rose hip oil and half almond oil in a glass apothecary bottle and.....wow! My previous face attempts left me with horrible cystic acne and many white heads.

I scrub skin with soap and a hand powered soft face scrub brush. Soap and brush bought from dollar tree, then i apply my mixture and steam my face twice a week to loosen clogged pores.

Almond oil absorbs quickly and leaves a my skin nourished while the rose hip helps my skin exfoliate and rid it of dead skin cells that lead to clogged pores with no irritation!!

I use this as my moisturizer, and after 2 days, I noticed the marks just flaked off my face, and the marks are barely detectable. People can't even tell (I can, but that's because I pay close attention), and I'm surprised how fast an oil will work in fading marks. Previously, I've used Placenta extract, lemon juice, lactic acid peels, you name it, for any marks I might have.

Too bad for me..I'm about 12 years late! :)  I have to say though, that the little diagram is about right for me so far.  See how the deep valley (side view of the wrinkle) is only a little dip in the second image?  That's what I see happening. I can see the lines, but they are really just lines now, not wrinkes. A few are gone completely.  The effect on my pores has been dramatic too. I didn't even mind my pores before, but now my skin just looks smooth and radiant.  I haven't worn foundation in about 2 weeks either. I don't want to hide my skin!! I am a freckle former in the sun..over the years they stopped fading, but they are fading now!

This should be IN CAPS or underlined or something! 1) If you have normal to dry skin you will probably want to use an additional moisturizer some of the time with this product.  It is warm now. In the winter, I know I will be needing it for sure! 2) If you use a retinol containing moisturizer you will regret it.  My face burned with heat, it got red, blotchy, swollen.

The major claim is that their new formula \"Stratys 3\" provides the best combination of moisturizers on the market, leaving your skin hydrated, but not sticky.  So, what exactly is \"Stratys 3\"?  A combination of glycerol quat, hydroxyethyl urea, and glycerin.  Glycerin is hygroscopic, meaning it attracts water, and glycerol quat is a compound supposed to attract and hold more water than glycerin.  Hydroxyethyl urea sometimes competes with glycerine for moisturizing effectiveness in the cosmetics market, but is thought to be less sticky.  Vaseline advertises that this particular trio, when used together work better than each works individually.  The advertising kind of dumbs it all down for us by saying it moisturizes \"the top, the core, and deep down\" parts of our skin.

I have repeatedly purchased this product. It is comparable to the C E Ferulic, Vitamin C Serum, by SkinCeuticals. The Skincueticals serum costs well over $100.

And, I find that each one I've tried gives me some sort of result usually even if it's just simply moisturizing my skin. But, if I had to pick a top 5 serums that promote the best results, this Vitamin C Plus E, Ferulic by Timeless Skincare would definitely be in there. This will help and has helped me to slough old skin cells to make brighter skin appear. It also helps to keep acne away and has lightened some of the dark spots or freckles from the sun on my face. My skin looks smoother overall. I've spent alot of time in the sun during my whole life, always living in the south, and now in Florida. Any younger people reading this in your teens and twenties you must take care of your skin now if you want to avoid wrinkles and sunspots as much as possible when you get older. I started using sunscreen religiously in my 30's but because I did not before then, I'm paying the price now. But, whatever your age, if you already have signs of aging from the sun like wrinkles and sunspots, this serum and the ingredients in it are some of the best to combat those issues.

Word of caution from someone who battled acne for 7+ years and just got it cleared out within the last 4 years: if you still have moderate/severe acne, it's best to keep your skin moisturized (and this oil is a good option - it may seem counterintuitive to put more oil on oily skin, that's the only way to prevent your body from making even more oil), but of course the oil alone won't be a miracle cure.

I don't like how half the product remains in the bottle, but at least it lets you twist off the cap and scrape the rest out.  It's just a little bit of a pain when you get to that phase.  And it bothers me that they probably design it this way so you will throw it away sooner and buy more faster.

Undereye darkness reduced within the first week and fine lines were less visible after two weeks.  I think it may be the Vitamin K that fades undereye darkness.  I have been using this twice daily for three months and I'm still on the first jar.  The skin around my eyes feels more supple.

So needless to say, I have tried many under eye treatments that have proved to be fruitless. I wanted to try something that is paraben free and had all natural ingredients and I stumbled across this after typing in \"dark circle eye treatment\" on Amazon. I was amazed at all of the great reviews and the the ratings, so I thought it would be worth the money since nothing I have used in the last 6-7 years has helped much. I received this eye cream a few days ago and was surprised at the amount they give you (pleasant surprise) and like the idea of using a waxier treatment instead of a more liquid or lotion consistency. I have been applying it after cleansing before bed and after cleansing and toning in the morning. My experience so far has been positive, the cream has a very faint and pleasant smell as well as it is very moisturizing. Some reviewers have mentioned that the cream is too thick and it is a goo idea to only apply it right before you fall asleep, but I beg to differ. The cream is so smooth and soft when applied to my skin the I even wear my concealer and powder over it during the daytime. My dark circles are something fierce (even after applying mac concealer and foundation, which says alot) so it will probably take at least  few more weeks or even a couple of months of consistent use of this cream to see real results.

I believe that over the years I have tried every product on the market that claims to reduce these dark circles (I'm 59) and not one of them has ever done anything to help. That is, until I tried Queen Bee Organic Under Eye Cream. This stuff is a miracle worker and is worth it's weight in gold. I had only been using it for one week and already noticed a huge difference. The darkness under my eyes had lightened up significantly. I have severe allergies, so my eyes water with that. This product does not burn my eyes like others, during allergy season when they water and itch. I haven't noticed it helping the lines beside my eyes, but I'm confident that with time those will fade as well. (Now if they could just come out with a product to help frown lines, that would be wonderful). I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers with dark under-eye circles.

I chose the San Paulo because the product pictures make it look like a bright, but peachy-ish pink.  As it turns out, it actually has a lot more of a purple/magenta undertone than I expected, or than the Amazon pictures make it appear.  That said, it's still a very nice color!  Just a bit different than I expected, and a little bolder as well.  And wow, do these lip creams have some serious staying power!  If you're looking for a nice, bright, pink-with-magenta-undertones that's matte and stays put, definitely go with San Paulo.  For the sake of variety, I have since gone to a local beauty store and bought another color as well (Antwerp) which is a bit closer to what I was originally looking for, but I know I will use both colors.

Also, splash cold water on your face and neck, and, leaving the water on, mix this in with the water, and let dry before adding any kind of makeup. The serum (which is thin as water), dries the skin as it dries, tightening it. Then put your concealer, foundation, etc. whatever you do.

When I put the cream on in the morning after washing my face, I would wait 10 minutes before putting on my foundation, in hopes that it would absorb. Nope! I put my liquid foundation on, and it just got stuck in the cream and together they made streaks and smears on my face. The worst part was, while on my face, the cream was extremely itchy. I felt like I needed to scratch my face all the time. By the 3rd day, it was starting to get really annoying and unbearable. I don't have sensitive skin so I don't really know why it was causing me all of these problems.

I really like the satin finish. I used to use olay as a base and then a satin finish cream on top before applying make up, NOW I can skip the satin finish expensive product and use this one for an all in one application. It makes my skin feel smooth and the satin finish keeps the make up from caking during the day.The pump is a super idea because you can regulate how much you use at a time compared to the jars and also the whole product is not exposed to getting any particles in it from your dressing table. Sometimes with the jar moisturizer you can get flicks of make up or other residue. With this you are assured that the product is clean coming out every time with just the right amount With Olay products a little goes a long way. With the jar I sometimes would get too much on my fingers and would apply the extra to my hands. With this new design there is no extra product to wipe off.

I didn't want to buy concealer or expensive eye creams so I researched the best approach to avoid eye area problems (dark circles, fine lines). The key is moisturizing on a daily basis.

It was my first time ever purchasing it, so I didn't know what to expect. It came in its original package but there was no seal after you unscrewed the lid. At the time, I had no idea it was supposed to come with a seal. The product had a pretty significant gap in it, but I naively blamed it on the product settling in transit. I used the product about 2-3 times a week and it lasted me about a month, MAYBE 5 weeks. It was great; it left my skin feeling baby smooth and looking bright. But for $40 and to only last a month? I couldn't rationalize it and decided not to repurchase. Fast forward to the holiday season; I received 2 of the Super Muds for Christmas from my sister. She purchased them directly from Glam Glow's website. I opened one to use it and found there was in fact a seal over the product. When I peeled back the seal, I found the container was completely full to the top. That's when I realized that what I purchased from Amazon was a USED container of the Glam Glow Super Mud.

But I will be the first to say it probably has different results depending on your skin type. I am 43 with dry skin & mostly fine wrinkles except for my \"wash board\" forehead. I am caucasian and my coloring is very uneven-lots of freckles, pink cheeks, red nose, broken blood vessels etc. I don't like heavy make up as most foundations either make my fine wrinkles more pronounced (especially the crepe paper skin around my eyes) while powders look chalky. The thick, waxy texture of miracle blur is fantastic on my skin; it blends in wonderfully and my moisture starved skin soaks it up. Everywhere except my forehead my skin looks virtually wrinkle free, and it does manage to soften the harsher deep wrinkles on my forehead. I LOVE the fact that it is a sunscreen too! It does not hide discolorations but rather slightly camouflages by softening edges. I can't imagine applying over make-up as some reviewers have suggested, but I do use a serum first, and if I am doing full makeup I will apply concealer & color corrector first. I then mix a small amount of tinted moisturizer or BB cream with the miracle blur (about a 1:2 ratio) and apply over. But most days I am happy just applying the miracle blur by itself. Miracle blur is also wonderful for the decolletage! You can also reapply to freshen up your look in the afternoon/evening. I will say I have noticed a very slight greasy feel towards the end of the day, which has never been a problem for me but I'm not so sure how it would work for someone with oily skin. However I believe they also make an oil free version. It is a bit pricey, but compared to the department store stuff it is it's moderate.

Together this is about the size of a large pea, smaller than a dime or marble. Mix the two together with my fingers and then apply and smooth on my face and neck. Some days I put makeup on and some days I don't, but my makeup looks so nice with this mixture as a foundation and even makeup free days I think the skin on my face looks smoother and less harsh than before I began using Miracle Blur and mixing it with my day lotion.

I get a variety of pimples-anything from small blackheads & tiny, bumpy whiteheads to deep cystic boils.  It took me 1 week to use a whole pack (I covered every flaw I had on my face to test the product).  For smaller bumps with or without a whitehead, the patches completely absorbed all oil/pus overnight and I woke up not being able to tell where the zit was.  I didn't have any larger zits (boils) this week to experiment on so I can't review the effects of the patch on those but I did have a few medium to larger-sized acne pimples that I tried the product on and the result was pretty good.  I had one zit in particular that kept refilling during the day while I was wearing makeup, then I would use a patch on it at night and voila....all drained by morning.  Unfortunately the zit would continue to slowly refill during the day and so I had to keep repeating this cycle.  I am now 7 days out and last night I finally popped it by squeezing, then covered with a patch and it appears that it is finally going away.  I did notice that with these more medium-sized pimples, the patch was not as effective if the zit had not been previously popped/opened.  I had a whitehead show up under my lip yesterday, I avoided popping it, put a patch on last night and woke up with all of the pus brought to the surface (so there was a large whitehead) but it had not been absorbed by the cover.  I was still happy that it helped the pus to surface and popped it myself this morning.  Sorry if this is TMI, but I have tried so many products over the years and reviews have always been very helpful for me in making purchasing decisions.  My overall impression of this product is very positive.  After a week of usage, I feel that my face is much clearer (though not perfect) and I don't pop/pick at my zits nearly as often.  I personally would not wear these patches during the day-they do not blend with skin well-unless you are a habitual picker and need something to keep your fingernails away.  I prefer to cover my flaws with makeup during the daytime hours and use these patches at night.  It's always a good feeling to see how much goo the patches pull out.

But, I had to review this product because it's truly amazing!  I saw a difference in my face after the very first time I used it!  I've used it twice a day everyday over the last 3 weeks or so since I purchased it and I've been seeing a consistent improvement over that time.  Every morning I'm excited to look in the mirror to see the results.  I've never experienced this with any other product I've ever used.  I actually see an improvement every single day!  I had discoloration, including age spots, wrinkles and saggy skin.  The difference I've noticed is a DRAMATIC decrease in the discoloration and age spots and I do mean dramatic!  Most age spots are completely gone and the worst ones are getting lighter everyday. My wrinkles are much less noticeable also.  I'm simply amazed how fresh and young my skin looks as far as the color and wrinkles.  You would think I used sun screen my entire life or stayed out of the sun but that's not the case.  I laid out a lot using little to no sun screen (usually a sun amplifier instead) in my teens up through my late 30s when I started noticing sun damage.  I also used a tanning bed up until my mid 20s so I had quite a bit of sun damage.  With this product, it's like I took an eraser and erased most of the sun damage.  I'm so excited about the possibility of not wearing any base this summer!  I was just told a couple of days ago that  I look like i'm in my mid 30s but I'm 46!  I didn't see a dramatic difference in the elasticity of my skin but there is some improvement.  They say you'll see full results within 6 months so I'm confident I will continue to see improvement.  I have noticed my skin feels incredibly smooth.  I love to touch my face and feel how soft and smooth it is.  This product does everything it promises to do.

For me and my skin type it is perfect, after a year my skin is much smoother to touch and healthier in appearance. I am 58yrs old and live in the southwest, my skin for years has felt and sadly looked dry and dull. I have gotten many compliments lately that I look healthier. I know everyone has different skin types and climate conditions but this little bottle has changed my skin and I can't say enough about it. Living in the southwest I have used almost every moisturizer out there from home remedies to high end regimens that did nothing. About 5yrs ago my skin, I know due to age, my skin started changing and was even getting worse, felt like sand paper and looked just awful, I had breakouts on my forehead, bumps, red spots etc. The dermatologist said it was rosacea, prescribed a tube of meds that cost $75 a pop, that did nothing. I saw AzureNat on amazon and it had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try but really wasn't expecting anything, the price was right so why not, I had just finished my last $75 tube of prescription med. Not too long after I started using the HA/Vit C I could see obvious changes. BTW if you have those little florescent curly bulbs overhead in your bath mirror, throw them out!! They make your skin look like crap! Spend a few more pennies and put in regular light bulbs. Anyway I knew I was on to something so I have been faithful using this product for just over a year and my skin has steadily improved each day. Now I have tried to add other products to my regimen, other Vit C (OzNat) and a couple other brands I found here on amazon because the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C is the magic and think I gave them all a fair trial, normally a couple months at a time, but I keep coming back to Azure Naturals because I keep getting the best results and each day gets better. Its been probably 10 months or so since my last forehead breakout. I have a few brown sun/age spots that honestly I do not think there is a product out there that will take them away completely, yes they are still there but a little lighter, I had a few bumps around my nose that seemed to stand out like beacons, I can still feel them under my skin, but you don't see them. My pores are almost non-existent and when I hold a mirror to the side of my face my cheeks, everything looks smooth and healthy. I love this stuff and would recommend it and will use it forever. I will say that you do not want to apply this before your workout because as you sweat anything you apply above your cheeks will run down into your eyes obviously, the HA and Vit C will make your eyes sting. Also at my last derm appt Doc asked if I needed a new scrip for the tube of med (can't remember the name of the med) for the rosacea because my skin was looking so good and I had to chuckle and tell her it was no thanks to that stuff and filled her in on what I was using.

I noticed the huge amounts of pimples, redness and a scale-like texture on my skin. (I've included some before pictures) I bought a clairsonic, a cleansing gel as well as some heavy duty moisturizer to try and combat the problem but it just wasn't good enough. My skin was still dry and exfoliating with the clairsonic only seemed to aggravated the break outs. I did some research online and I came across this product and read the reviews. I was shocked at how many people loved this product and the positive feedback and results other people were getting. I decided to order two bottles when I first purchased this product and I can say I AM IN LOVE.. This is everything my skin was missing and I've been ranting and raving about it to my friends and family who also deal with the same problems. My skin has cleared up, has been able to retain the moisture way better than ever before, and it gives my skin brightness! I don't know how to explain it. My skin looks fabulous now! My first two bottles lasted about a year and I've ordered four more bottles now. Two for myself and two for my mother-in-law. I've also ordered the night cream as you still need to moisturize your skin if you have really dry skin like mine but this will forever be in my skin regime!

Here is the skinny on this serum. I can't stand when people review skin products without saying what their skin type is, and what their age is, because this is a HUGE factor on whether or not this may work for you. I am 41, I have oily cheeks and large pores on my nose. I also have super dry skin around my eyes and mouth area (where dreaded wrinkles form). So I found myself needing a cleanser that kind of dries me out, but clears breakouts, but also is causing wrinkles to deepen, UGH. Aging isn't easy! So in comes the newest crazy, hyaluronic acid. So I cleansed my face with my ultimate holy grail cleanser, the DermaSafe Gycolic/Hyaluronic Vitamin C Exfoliator, and was excited to see how this serum would back that up. First...it came packaged wonderfully! No damage,or broken anything, and it was sealed tight. The fluid is thick-ish, but NOT a cream or gel at all, it comes out runny. You can apply it without it running all over the place though, which is nice. First impression is it dried quick, thirsty parts of my skin felt \"tight\", and almost over dried. I didn't love that. My oily parts loved it more, I noticed that my cheeks started instantly glowing, while around my eyes and mouth started to CRACK! Oh heck no! What I did was applied my normal night cream (rivita-lift) around my eyes, and mouth and it felt so much better! So...I think that if you have oily skin, and struggle with acne, discoloration, or scarring (which I still do at 41) this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to you. I see a difference in those areas almost instantly. My skin feels plumper, clearer, and smooth! The dry parts where age is taking control didn't care for it as much. It needs to be paired with another moisturizer for sure. So, gave it four stars for that reason.

It's all natural so this is great for those of us who are really using this for serious skin plumping, anti-aging purposes.

It's supposed to smell like strawberries and champagne but I have to say it's less berry sweet smell and more fresh and light champagne. A little goes a long way. Maybe it's the silicone that makes it so silky. The bottle has a neat feature.
